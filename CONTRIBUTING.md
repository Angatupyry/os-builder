# Contributing to os-builder

## Basic guidelines

1. Never push directly to master (this should be enforced by github already).
2. Create a new branch, e.g. `git checkout -b add-feature-x`, commit changes and push the branch. Then create the PR.
3. Never merge your own PR. Ask somebody to review it.
4. Only the reviewer should merge the PR.
5. It's OK to go back and forth, and changes things in your branch, until the PR is acceptable.
6. It's OK to merge the PR using the `Squash and merge button`.
7. Code, comments, commit messages and PR discussions should be in English. In order to make this project more inviting to the community.
8. Always delete the branch after the PR is merged.
